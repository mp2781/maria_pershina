Research
I defended my PhD thesis in Computer Science Department at New York University. My research interests include Machine Learning, Language Processing, Algorithms, Information Extraction. I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Ralph Grishman and to be a part of  Proteus Project. During my years at NYU I collaborated with Wei Xu, Yifan He, Thien Nguyen, Bonan Min, Xiang Li, Mohamed Yakout (MSR), Kaushik Chakrabarti (MSR).
